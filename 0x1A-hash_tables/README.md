# 0x1A. C - Hash Tables

## Overview

This project revolves around the implementation of hash tables in C, delving into the concepts of hash functions, hash table design, and handling collisions. The project aims to provide a deeper understanding of hash tables and their application through a series of tasks.

## Learning Objectives

Upon completion of this project, you should be capable of explaining:

- The concept of a hash function
- Properties of a good hash function
- The architecture and functionality of a hash table and its application
- Strategies to handle collisions within a hash table
- The advantages and disadvantages of using hash tables
- Common use cases of hash tables in various applications

## Copyright - Plagiarism

Originality is highly valued in this project. The tasks should be solved independently to achieve the learning objectives outlined. Plagiarism in any form is strictly prohibited.

## Requirements

- **Allowed Editors:** vi, vim, emacs
- **Compiling Environment:** Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using GCC with the following flags: `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`
- **Files Specification:**
    - Code should end with a new line
    - A `README.md` file is mandatory at the project's root folder
    - Code should follow the Betty style
    - No usage of global variables
    - Each file should contain no more than 5 functions
    - Allowed usage of the C standard library
    - Prototypes for functions should be declared in the header file `hash_tables.h`
    - Don't forget to push the header file
    - Header files should be include guarded

## Data Structures

The project mandates the use of the following data structures:

```c
typedef struct hash_node_s {
     char *key;
     char *value;
     struct hash_node_s *next;
} hash_node_t;

typedef struct hash_table_s {
     unsigned long int size;
     hash_node_t **array;
} hash_table_t;
```

## Tasks

The project tasks include implementing essential functions related to hash tables. Here's a brief of each task:

1. `hash_table_create`: Function to create a hash table of a specified size.
2. `hash_djb2`: Hash function using the djb2 algorithm.
3. `key_index`: Function to return the index of a key within the hash table.
4. `hash_table_set`: Function to add an element to the hash table.
5. `hash_table_get`: Function to retrieve a value associated with a key.
6. `hash_table_print`: Function to print the content of a hash table.
7. `hash_table_delete`: Function to delete a hash table.

## Testing

To verify the correctness and functionality of each task, sample tests have been included in the project. Each task includes its respective test files for validation.
