Bit manipulation

Bit manipulation is a fundamental concept in computer science and programming, especially when dealing with low-level operations and optimizing code. Here's a list of important concepts to master in bit manipulation, along with some resources for further understanding and research:

**1. Binary Representation and Number Systems:**
   - Understanding binary representation of numbers and its importance in bit manipulation.
   - Understanding hexadecimal and octal number systems.

**2. Bitwise Operators:**
   - AND (&), OR (|), XOR (^), NOT (~), left shift (<<), and right shift (>>).
   - Learning how these operators manipulate individual bits in numbers.

**3. Bitwise Manipulation Techniques:**
   - Setting a bit (bitwise OR with 1).
   - Clearing a bit (bitwise AND with 0).
   - Toggling a bit (bitwise XOR with 1).
   - Checking if a bit is set or not.
   - Counting set bits (also known as the "Hamming weight").

**4. Bitwise Tricks:**
   - Swapping values of two variables without using a temporary variable.
   - Finding the most significant bit (MSB) and least significant bit (LSB) that is set.

**5. Bitmasking:**
   - Using masks to isolate specific bits and perform operations.
   - Applying masks for flag manipulation and bitmasking techniques.

**6. Bit Manipulation in Algorithms:**
   - Using bitwise operations to optimize algorithms.
   - Efficient arithmetic operations using bit manipulation.

**7. Bitwise Operations in Data Structures:**
   - Implementing bitwise operations in data structures like bitsets and bitmaps.

**8. Advanced Topics:**
   - Gray code and its applications.
   - Bit manipulation for specific tasks (CRC computation, hash functions, etc.).
